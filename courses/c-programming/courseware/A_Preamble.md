# Preamble

## COMSM1201: Programming in C

## About the Course

These course notes were originally based on:

C By Dissection (3rd edition)  
Al Kelley and Ira Pohl

because I liked arrays being taught late(r).  
I've since changed my mind a little & have re-jigged the notes quite heavily over the years.

## Resources

*   Free: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming
*   A list of more: https://www.linuxlinks.com/excellent-free-books-learn-c/
*   Whatever you use, make sure it's C99 that's being taught, not something else e.g. C11 or C++.
*   If you fall in love with C and know you're going to use it for the rest of your life, the reference 'bible' is K&R 2nd edition. It's not a textbook for those new to programming, though.

SECOND EDITION  
THE C ANSI C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE  
BRIAN W. KERNIGHAN  
DENNIS M. RITCHIE  
PRENTICE HALL SOFTWARE SERIES

## Computer Science Ethos

*   Talk to your friends, ask for help, work together.
*   Never pass off another persons work as your own.
*   Do not pass work to others - either on paper or electronically - even after the submission deadline - it’s against our rules.
*   If someone takes your code and submits it, we need to investigate where it originated - all students involved will be part of this.
*   Don’t place your code on publicly accessible sites e.g. github - other students may have extensions etc.

## History of C

Languages:  
Various Influences → BCPL (1965-7) → B (1969) → New B (1971) → Early C (1972-3) → ...

Operating System:  
UNIX (written in PDP-7 assembler) → UNIX (written in PDP-11 assembler) → UNIX in C → ...

Hardware:  
PDP-7 → PDP-11 → IBM 360 → Honeywell 635

*   BCPL - Martin Richards
*   B - Ken Thomson 1970
*   Both of above are typeless.
*   C - Dennis Ritchie 1972 designed for (& implemented on) a UNIX system.
*   K&R C (Kernighan and Ritchie) 1978
*   ANSI C
*   C99 (COMS1201)
*   C++ Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
*   Java (Subset of C++, WWW enabled).

https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/

*   One of the most commonly used programming languages according to tiobe.com
*   Low-level (c.f. Java)
*   Doesn't hide nitty-gritty
*   Fast?
*   Large parts common to Java

## Programming and Software Engineering

*   Lectured 4 hours per week (Neill & Kira) for weeks 1-12 (barring week 6)
*   Programming (C), data structures, algorithms - searching, sorting, string processing, trees etc.

## Assessment

*   Weekly (unmarked) exercises that, if completed, should ensure you are able to pass the unit.
*   Four assignments and final exam.
*   Hard to gauge timings, so don't make any plans in advance - I'll change it if we're going too fast.

## Help with Computers

*   Any problems with the computers e.g. installing the correct S/W, accessing lab machines : http://www.bris.ac.uk/it-services/
*   They are also the people to see about passwords etc.
*   This page also links to the rather useful Laptop & Mobile Clinic.

## Help with the Unit

*   All information is available via the Blackboard site (which will point you to other sites including github.com, MS Teams etc.)
*   Online support is given via the Teams Group.
*   The main learning resource is our 6 hour of labs per week staffed by TAs.
*   TAs are not allowed to write pieces of code for you, nor undertake detailed bug-fixing of your program.
